  content: From a young age I was encouraged to be outdoors, exploring on my own. I used to take the Melbourne tram network to school and back, but would often detour into the city to be part of the busy hustle and bustle that the CBD had to offer. Now I'm a versed traveller around Australia, having spent most of my life in Melbourne and parts of it exploring other cities, however, there is always something new to see and do, it's constantly changing. Recently I've been travelling in a van with my partner, Hannah. Together we self converted a camper van and travelled 16 countries around Europe. Our next stop is home for me, and abroad for her - to Melbourne.
