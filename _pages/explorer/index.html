  subtitle: Host of Outback Wrangler
  content: I’m a proud animal conservationist and host of National Geographic's TV show Outback Wrangler, which is a wildlife program about my work catching and relocating large salt-water crocodiles in the Top End of Australia. I was raised in tropical far-north Queensland and have spent time in Papua New Guinea and central Australia, living off the land and working with an array of Australian wildlife including rouge cattle and saltwater crocodiles. Today my time is split between running my tourism business and flying my helicopter as a wildlife re-locator - tracking down, capturing and transporting animals from around the world including crocodiles, wild buffalo and Polar Bears to name a few!

      - title: Wild Australia Private Tours
        locations:
        content: The Australian outback, its animals and landscapes, is my passion and I love nothing more than sharing my adventures with other people. I design unique once in a lifetime experiences with my Wild Australia Private Tours. A popular tour that everyone loves (whether you’re a fisherman or not!) is my Heli-fishing Adventure where I fly guests out of Darwin to some of the most remote locations in the world to fish and explore. I also design one week expeditions where people can get a taste for the best bits of the Top End and Kimberley regions including fishing, animal encounters, camping, mustering - the list goes on and can be customized to whatever you want.

      - title: Outback Floatplane Adventures
        locations:
        content: If you’re interested in an awesome crocodile and outback adventure in just half a day then the Ultimate Tourby Outback Floatplane Adventures is for you! It begins with a 20-minute floatplane flight and spectacular landing on the floodplains of Sweets Lagoon. A cruise boat takes you for a journey down the river where you have a nice feed, which is followed by exhilarating airboat rides through the Northern Territory’s backwaters. You’ll get up close and personal to birdlife and big saltwater crocodiles. And remember to pack your bathers because there’s a croc safe swimming cage you can have a dip in while you’re out there!

      - title: Barefoot Tours
        locations:
        content: The guys that run these tours give you Aussie larrikin style humour at its best! This is my top pick when visiting Cairns; it’s a casual, easy and enjoyable way to experience the Atherton Tablelands and waterfalls. Among other things you will get to swim underneath waterfalls, go for a dip in a volcanic crater and speed down a natural water slide. And the best thing about this tour is that the itinerary is never fixed so it has a chilled out go with the flow vibe to it.  It’s good value for money with yummy food and snacks including local bananas and our national hero Tim Tams.

      - title: Calypso Star Tours
        locations:
        content: Port Lincoln is the only place you can cage dive with Great White Sharks in Australia. I spend my life up close to big crocs and diving alongside different sharks in open water but being able to get close up to a great white was something else. I recommend booking this trip between May and October during whale season because our boat was accompanied by a pod of dolphins and a couple of whales, which really added to the day. If you’re not into sharks then you can book a different tour to swim with the Australian Sealions, also known as the puppies of the sea.
