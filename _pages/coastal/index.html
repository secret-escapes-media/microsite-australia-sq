I started out as a 16-year-old trainee which made me the youngest ever Professional Lifeguard to patrol Bondi Beach. Now, after 10 years, I still I love meeting visitors, helping people and serving the community. I am passionate about inspiring young people and helping to keep them safe, something I do in my spare time through other projects I am involved in and the children’s water safety book series I am co-writing.

Boasting beautiful rainforest expanses, where crocodiles and Olive Ridley turtles can be observed in their natural habitat, Tiwi can only be explored with the aid of a local guide. Indulge in some “catch and release” and attempt to bait yourself a native fish, witness the island’s majestic waterfalls, or purchase handmade wares from the local indigenous people, discovering more about their way of life. Tiwi is home to the deluxe Bathurst Island Lodge, a secluded hotel on the beach front, offering outstanding views of the Top End’s famous blistered, orange sunset.

      - title: Nielsen Park
        locations:
          - title: Vaucluse
            airport: Sydney
        content: One of my favorite quiet, local spots, away from busy Bondi, is Nielsen Park in Vaucluse which is still in the eastern suburbs. It is part of the Sydney Harbour National Park and the lovely old kiosk there dates back to the early 1900’s. Sometime I just walk through and grab a coffee from the café or a bite to eat – you can get great views of the harbour. If I have a bit more time it is a great spot for a swim, as it is a protected little cove – it’s one of the best swimming spots in the harbour.

      - title: Boat Harbour Beach
        locations:
          - title: Kurnell Peninsula
            airport: Sydney
        content: Boat Harbour Beach is a hidden gem as it’s one of the last 4WD spots in Sydney where you can still actually drive along the beach – it’s an unpatrolled beach about 30km south of the city. I love a bit of beach cricket and this is the perfect place to have a hit! If you have a 4WD you can load up the car for the day, park right on the beach and have a BBQ or picnic. Another bonus I like about Boat Harbour is that you can bring the dog for a walk along this beach, so the whole family can join in.

      - title: Tangalooma, Moreton Island
        locations:
          - title: Moreton Island
            airport: Brisbane or Gold Coast
        content: Tangalooma Island is an easy day trip from Brisbane being only a one-hour boat ride from the city. Its claim to fame is being the second-largest sand island in the world. There is so much to do on the island but I loved taking the bus out to the sandy desert so we could go tobogganing down the sand dunes. The climb up tests the legs but coming down at 40km an hour is a lot of fun. The highlight to end my day was feeding the wild dolphins at sunset. It is truly unique to see dolphins in their natural habitat – they come into shore at the same time every night to catch a feed which is just amazing.

      - title: Rottnest Island
        locations:
          - title: Rottnest Island
            airport: Perth
        content: I have made three trips to Rottnest Island – or ‘Rotto’ as the locals call it. I took part in the world-famous Rottnest Channel Swim, where over a 1000 people swim the 20km from the mainland to the island. My swims average about six hours but I suggest doing the easy route of a 40-minute boat trip from Perth! The island is famous for its little Quokkas, a tiny wallaby-like creature, so make sure you look out for them. There are also many beautiful coves to explore and perfect white beaches, so put it on your WA bucket list!
